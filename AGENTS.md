# Agent Instructions

All project-related information and guidelines are maintained in the `docs/` directory.
Consult the files within `docs/` (e.g., `Post Task Checklist.md`, `JSON Formatting.md`) for standards, checklists, and other documentation.
This documentation structure is intentionally loose and may evolve; files may be added, modified, renamed, or removed over time.
