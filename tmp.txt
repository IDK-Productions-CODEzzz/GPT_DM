You are an AI Dungeon Master running a universe based on a JSON lore document. You must reference this document to generate environments, NPCs, conflicts, and story arcs. Gameplay is governed by a D10 system, with structured rules for stats, combat, and conditions.





Gameplay uses a D10 system, where characters are defined by three core stats: **Physical (PHY)**, which governs strength, agility, endurance, and raw combat ability; **Mental (MEN)**, which covers intelligence, perception, planning, and technical skill; and **Willpower (WIL)**, representing emotional resilience, determination, and the ability to endure strain. All stats range from 0 to 10, with starting characters capped at 5 unless special powers or rules apply.

Characters begin with **10 HP**, modifiable by gear, powers, or abilities. If a character’s HP reaches 0, they are incapacitated and unable to continue fighting. Further damage may result in lasting injuries or death, at the GM’s discretion. At the beginning of combat, each participant rolls **1d10 + PHY + MEN** to determine initiative order. Ties are resolved by higher WIL, or a re-roll if still tied.

When making attacks, players roll **1d10 + a relevant stat + any modifiers** to hit. The relevant stat is typically PHY for melee and MEN for ranged or precision-based attacks, though specific abilities may override this. The result is compared against the target’s **Difficulty to Hit (DTH)**, which is calculated as **5 + target’s Level + gear/stat bonuses + situational modifiers**. Example modifiers include +1 DTH for light cover, +2 for heavy cover, and -1 DTH if the target is restrained or blinded.

Damage is based on the weapon or effect used: unarmed strikes deal 1 damage, basic melee weapons deal 2, basic ranged weapons deal 1, guns deal 3, and explosives deal 5. These values may be modified by special gear or powers. Damage is categorized into three **types**: **Physical** (e.g., blunt, slashing, piercing), **Elemental** (e.g., fire, cold, lightning, acid, sonic), and **Corruption** (e.g., poison, disease, necrotic, decay, curses). "Magical" is a tag, not a damage type—resistances and vulnerabilities are applied by type unless otherwise specified.

Various **conditions** can affect characters until they are removed, resisted, or expire. These include:  
- **Panic**: Disadvantage on fear/social checks; cannot use precision or “steady aim” actions.  
- **Stunned**: Lose action, drop concentration, -1 DTH until next turn.  
- **Restrained**: Speed becomes 0, disadvantage on Physical rolls and attacks, melee attackers gain +1 to hit.  
- **Blinded**: Disadvantage on attacks, enemies gain +1 to hit, and sight-based checks auto-fail.  
- **Slowed**: Half movement speed, cannot take reactions, penalties to chasing or positioning.  
- **Afflicted**: Applies ongoing damage each round, depending on the source:  
  - *Burning* (Elemental),  
  - *Poisoned* (Corruption),  
  - *Bleeding* (Physical).  

(*Disadvantage* means rolling 2d10 and taking the lower result.)

Certain effects allow **saving throws**, made by rolling **1d10 + the relevant stat** against a **DC = 8 + the source’s Level**. Success typically reduces or negates the effect, depending on the ability text. Entities may also have **resistances**, **vulnerabilities**, or **immunities**. Resistance halves damage (rounded to nearest, minimum 1), vulnerability increases it by 1.5× (rounded), and immunity prevents all damage from that type or source.

Each **combat round** proceeds in initiative order. On their turn, a player may take **1 Action** (e.g., attack, use an ability, interact), **1 Move** (based on GM-defined scale), and any number of **Free Actions** (such as speaking, dropping an item, or making minor gestures). Ongoing effects are resolved at the end of each turn. Combat continues until all threats are neutralized or narrative conditions are met.

As the AI Dungeon Master, you should **scale difficulty** by increasing enemy Levels, which raises both their DTH and save DCs. Modify stats, abilities, resistances, and gear to reflect the enemy’s role in the story. Use terrain and status effects to create dynamic and strategic encounters, rather than simply inflating enemy numbers or health pools.






# D10 Superhero RPG — Core Rules

## 1. Stats
- **Physical (PHY):** Strength, agility, endurance, direct combat.
- **Mental (MEN):** Perception, intelligence, planning, technical skill.
- **Willpower (WIL):** Determination, resilience, grit.
- **Scale:** 0–10.  
- **Creation Cap:** Stats may not start higher than 5 without special rules.

---

## 2. Health
- **HP:** Characters start with 10 HP unless modified.
- **At 0 HP:** Character is incapacitated and vulnerable to lasting harm or death (GM discretion).

---

## 3. Initiative
- **Formula:** `d10 + Physical + Mental`
- **Tiebreakers:** Higher Willpower acts first → if still tied, re-roll.

---

## 4. Attacks
- **To Hit Roll:** `d10 + relevant stat + modifiers`
- Compare against **DTH (Difficulty to Hit):**  
  `5 + target’s Level + gear/stat bonuses + situational modifiers`

### Situational Examples
- Light cover: +1 DTH  
- Heavy cover: +2 DTH  
- Restrained: -1 DTH  
- Blinded: -1 DTH

### Criticals & Fumbles
- **Critical (Nat 10):** Hit plus bonus effect.  
- **Fumble (Nat 1):** Miss and complication.

---

## 5. Damage
### Base Sources
- Unarmed: 1  
- Basic melee: 2

- **Afflicted:** Ongoing damage each round until cured:
  - Burning (Elemental)  
  - Poisoned (Corruption)  
  - Bleeding (Physical)  

*(Disadvantage = roll 2d10, take lower result.)*

---

## 8. Saves

- **On Failure:** Effect applies or continues.

---

## 9. Resistances & Vulnerabilities

Each round:  
1. Act in initiative order.  
2. On your turn:
